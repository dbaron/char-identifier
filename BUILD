Build instructions for char-identifier extension.

In a source tree from the Mozilla trunk, extract the source tarball
inside of mozilla/extensions/

Change directory to <objdir>/extensions/

Execute the following commands (if your objdir is your srcdir, you need
to do the first one considerably earlier!):
	rm -rf char-identifier ../dist/xpi-stage/char-identifier*
	make MOZ_EXTENSIONS=char-identifier

You now have the xpi in
<objdir>/dist/xpi-stage/char-identifier-<version>.xpi
